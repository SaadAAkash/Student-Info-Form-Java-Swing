This is an interactive student form made using Java GUI (Graphical User Interface). This is a personal Java GUI project in which I treis to put up some radio buttons, drop down boxes and dropdown boxes having some predefined options. The predefined options are set for the constraints and to ensure that anyone not satisfying those eligibilities doesn't get to fill up the form. This form is entirely coded in Java and it basically takes the information as the input data. This form can applied to schools and colleges. Specially this type of data storage is much needed in fragile education administrations in the third world countries. If these datas (which is now saved in an auto-generated text file for building a prototype) can be sent to a central database of that institution, this system can be efficient and convenient for monitoring.
